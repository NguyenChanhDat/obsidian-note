The distinction between **primitive data types** and **object types** in JavaScript exists for performance and usability reasons. Here's why JavaScript has both and why we don't just use `new String`, `new Number`, etc., for everything:

### 1. **Performance**: 
   - **Primitives are lightweight**: Primitive data types like strings, numbers, booleans, and symbols are stored in memory more efficiently than objects. They are immutable (cannot be changed), and operations on them are generally faster.
   - **Objects have more overhead**: Creating an object like `new String('foo')` or `new Number(42)` involves more memory allocation, as objects need to store more metadata, like properties and methods. They are also mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are created, which adds complexity.

Primitives allow JavaScript to be more efficient when handling simple, frequently-used values, while objects are reserved for more complex data structures.

### 2. **Simplicity for developers**:
   - **Convenience**: Using primitive types directly (e.g., `42` instead of `new Number(42)`, or `'hello'` instead of `new String('hello')`) makes code simpler and easier to write. You donâ€™t need to think about constructing objects or managing memory.
   - **Less verbose code**: For example, instead of writing:
     ```javascript
     const myString = new String('hello');
     ```
     You can simply write:
     ```javascript
     const myString = 'hello';
     ```
     This reduces verbosity and is more intuitive for everyday programming.

### 3. **Historical reasons and language design**:
   - **JavaScript's origins**: JavaScript was initially designed to be a lightweight scripting language for the web, focusing on ease of use for non-programmers. By offering primitive types, JavaScript allows simpler and more efficient code for basic data types.
   - **Object wrappers for advanced functionality**: When the language designers needed to add advanced methods and properties (e.g., `.toUpperCase()` for strings or `.toFixed()` for numbers), they added object wrappers. This gave developers the benefits of object-oriented programming without sacrificing the efficiency and simplicity of primitives.

### 4. **Balance between simplicity and power**:
   - **Primitive for simplicity**: Primitives are used for basic operations, where speed and efficiency are important. For example, adding two numbers (`2 + 3`) should be as fast as possible, and you don't need an object for that.
   - **Object wrappers for power**: When you need more functionality, like calling a method on a string (`'hello'.toUpperCase()`), the primitive can be temporarily "boxed" into an object to provide that functionality. This is the best of both worlds: simple for basic use cases but powerful when needed.

### 5. **Immutability of primitives**:
   - **Primitives are immutable**: This means their value cannot be changed. For example, if you have `let str = 'hello';`, you can't directly change any part of that string, which helps avoid bugs that come from unexpected mutations. Instead, you would create a new string, like `str = str.toUpperCase();`.
   - **Objects are mutable**: Object data types, on the other hand, can have their properties or values changed, which is more powerful but also more prone to errors or unintended side effects in programs.

### Why Not Just Use `new String`, `new Number`, etc.?

Using `new String`, `new Number`, or `new Boolean` everywhere would cause unnecessary overhead and lead to confusing behavior. For example:
- **Type inconsistencies**: When you use `new String()` or `new Number()`, you're creating an object, not a primitive. As discussed earlier, this can lead to unexpected results when comparing values strictly (`===`):
   ```javascript
   new String('hello') === 'hello'  // false
   ```
   The object is not the same as the primitive value, which would introduce confusion.

- **Unnecessary complexity**: Having to wrap everything in an object when primitives suffice would make code more cumbersome and harder to maintain:
   ```javascript
   const num = new Number(42);  // instead of simply using 42
   ```

- **Mutation issues**: Using `new String` or `new Number` creates objects, which are mutable. This can lead to potential bugs if you're not careful, as object values can be changed, while primitives remain immutable.

### Conclusion
JavaScript includes primitive data types for **simplicity, performance, and efficiency**. Object types like `new String()` or `new Number()` are provided when you need more advanced functionality, but they are not required for basic use cases. This balance makes JavaScript both **efficient** for simple tasks and **powerful** when needed.
