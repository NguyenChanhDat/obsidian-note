```
console.log(varA); // Output: ReferenceError: varA is not defined ...
let varA = 'The variable has been hoisted.';
```

varA is still hoisted to the top of it's scope. It didn't return undefined, but ReferenceError instead cuz it in a "temporal deadzone" (TDZ) [[202410022205_temporal_dead_zone(TDZ)_definition.md]], while in TDZ the varA has not been initialized with value
